\section{Research Activities}
My main research activities are developed within the field of Cloud Computing. They concern managing resources and enabling new services in the 
Cloud. Recently, I have been working on designing and developing a new model for SLA description, deployment and management. My research also 
includes different standardization efforts. During the last year, I have been working on extending OCCI standard to provide an Autonomic 
Computing infrastructure for Cloud Resources. I participated also on extending OCCI for the Platform and Application levels. 
\subsection{SLA description and management}
In this work, we are designing a new language for SLA description that we call rSLA. By this language, we aim to propose a very simple and human 
readable manner to describe all the aspects of SLA using a simple yet powerful ruby-based DSL. Behind that, we are building a holistic infrastructure 
that allows deploying the SLA and binding all required services to enable the management and enforcement of SLAs.
\subsection{Enterprise Persistence for PaaS}
PaaS platforms such as Cloud Foundry typically do not support an inherent persistence model but rely on service access to persistence services. We 
explore ways of providing enterprise grade object and file system services in the context of containerized application instances for scenarios that 
still require traditional persistence access such as the reliance on existing tools and libraries or the sharing of data with other applications 
expecting traditional, direct data access.
\subsection{OCCI Extension for Platform and Application}
In this work, we proposed a model that extends the OCCI core Model to describe Platform and Application resources (see [3,T2]). It provides a generic representation of existing platforms and their components. The extension entails all the needed OCCI Resources and Links that allow the provision of Platform and Application Resources. Furthermore, we proposed COAPS as a generic REST API (see [T1]) that allows to seamlessly provision applications over different PaaS providers (e.g., CloudFoundry, OpenShift, Google App Engine). This API is based on the OCCI extension for Platform and Application. 
\subsection{OCCI Extension for Autonomic Computing}
% Cloud computing is a recent paradigm in Information Technology enabling an economic model for virtual resources provisioning. For this paradigm, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a pillar block to build applications. To efficiently manage Service-based applications in the Cloud, monitoring and reconfiguration remain important tasks but it is still a challenge to find a solution that reconciles the scalability, the memory consumption, and the efficiency. 
 In this work, we extended OCCI standards to provide Monitoring and Reconfiguration facilities for Cloud Resources (see [2]). We pushed farther this work to provide an Autonomic Computing Loop for Cloud Resources independently of their level (see [T3]). The extension entails all the needed Entities (i.e., Resources and Links) and Mixins that, starting from a Service Level Agreement (SLA), gather and analyze monitoring data. And eventually, generate and apply reconfiguration actions on the concerned Resources to honor the SLA.
\subsection{Scalable Micro-container for service-based applications in cloud computing}
In this work, we proposed a new Service container dedicated to one deployed service that avoids 
the processing limits of classical Service containers. Our approach addresses scalability by reducing memory consumption and response time. The 
proposed Service container is evaluated in several situations against well known service containers within a real Cloud Computing network. 
The evaluation results show the scalability of the proposed Micro-container.
% \section{Master thesis}
% \cvitem{Title}{\emph{Scalable Micro-container for service-based applications in cloud computing}}
% \cvitem {Description}{Cloud Computing is a new supplement, consumption, and delivery model for IT services based on Internet protocols. It typically involves provisioning of dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources. In this environment, there are several issues related to the inadequacies of hosting platforms and mechanisms to ensure the smooth running of Service-based applications. In particular, architectures and implementations of Service containers are not adapted to Cloud environments. During this Master, we presented a new Service container dedicated to one deployed service that avoids the processing limits of classical Service containers. Our approach addresses scalability by reducing memory consumption and response time. The proposed Service container is evaluated in several situations against well known services containers within a real Cloud Computing network [7,8]. The evaluation results show the scalability of the proposed Micro-container.}
